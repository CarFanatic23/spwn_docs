# Script Assisted Building

Now that you have the power to make complicated trigger machines in Geometry Dash relatively easily, we can now move on to learn how to make things other than triggers using SPWN. Up until now, much of the SPWN code we have been writing has been code that will be "executed" while the level runs, or at _runtime_. However, when building things other than triggers using SPWN, pretty much all of the code will be executed while the code compiles, or at _compiletime_. Since we don't have to deal with the limits of Geometry Dash as much at compiletime, some useful new features of SPWN are now available to us. Many of these features can be found in the _Built-in functions_. Read about these on the [next page](scriptassistedbuilding/1builtin.md).

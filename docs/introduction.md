# SPWN

First off, let's get to know the basic workflow of using SPWN.
SPWN is designed so that you can work in the editor and in SPWN at the same time, using the editor for it's strengths, and SPWN for it's.

> To "compile" your SPWN program, you use the command `spwn run [file]`, where `[file]` is the path to your SPWN script.
> This command will do the following:
>
> - Read your levels contents
> - Compile your SPWN program to Geometry Dash objects, making sure to not have them interfear with the things that are already in your level.
> - Append the new objects onto your level
